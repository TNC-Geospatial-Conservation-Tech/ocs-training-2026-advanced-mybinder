# OCS 2026 Training - Advanced Module | Binder Repository

**Launch Advanced Module Notebooks:** [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/TNC-Geospatial-Conservation-Tech/ocs-training-2026-advanced-mybinder/main)

The main Spatial Data Science Virtual Training 2026 repo can be found here: https://github.com/TNC-Geospatial-Conservation-Tech/ocs-2026-training

This repo is specifically organized for the live version of the Advanced Module taking place at the times listed below.

To view **and execute python** notebook cells, use the `Binder` badge above to launch a small (ephemeral) compute environment.
